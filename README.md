# machine-learning-projects
In this project, we’ll be using Credit Card Approval Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The structure of our project will be as follows —
To get a basic introduction of our project & What’s the business problem associated with it ?
  1.We’ll start by loading and viewing the dataset.
  2.To manipulate data, if there are any missing entries in the dataset.
  3.To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on our dataset.
  4.To pre-process data before applying machine learning model to the dataset.
  5.To apply machine learning model that can predict if an individual’s application for a credit card will be accepted or not.
